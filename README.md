## Features

### Competition Management
- Create, edit, save, load, delete competitions
- Each competition stores teams, rounds, scores, and settings
- Data persists in SQLite — no loss on restart

### Team Management
- Dynamic teams — add, edit, delete, enable/disable
- Each team has a name, color, and score
- Default: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta

### Scoreboard
- Real-time score updates via WebSocket
- Quick-add buttons: -10, -5, +5, +10, +20
- Direct score set with input field
- Auto-sorted by score

### Question Timer
- Configurable durations: 5s, 10s, 15s, 20s, 30s, 60s
- Controls: Start, Pause, Resume, Reset
- Visual bar + animated countdown
- "TIME'S UP!" alert with sound
- Synchronized across all connected devices

### Round Management
- Create named rounds (Round 1, Round 2, ... Semi Final, Final)
- Open/close rounds
- Rename rounds
- Track which team won each round

### Answer Validation Workflow
1. Team wins buzzer
2. Awaiting answer state activates
3. Judge selects: Correct (+points), Wrong (optional penalty), Skip
4. All actions logged to audit trail

### Rebuttal Mode
- After a wrong answer, judge activates rebuttal
- Configurable lock period prevents immediate buzzing
- After lock, buzzers reopen for other teams
- Visual "REBUTTAL" badge on dashboard

### Advanced Display Screens
- **Main view**: Winner + connected teams
- **Scoreboard view**: Full ranking table
- **Winner view**: Full-screen winner announcement
- All views auto-synchronize in real time

### OBS Overlay Mode
- Browser-source compatible transparent overlays
- `overlay/winner` — floating winner name
- `overlay/score` — top 5 scores
- `overlay/timer` — countdown timer
- Zero configuration — just add as browser source in OBS

### Multi-Judge Support
- **Main Judge**: Full control (start/reset, scores, teams, settings)
- **Assistant Judge**: Limited control
- **Viewer**: Read-only access
- Permissions enforced server-side

### Data Persistence (SQLite)
- All data persists to SQLite database
- Competitions, teams, scores, rounds, settings, audit logs
- No data loss on server restart
- WAL mode for concurrent read performance

### Audit Log System
- Every action logged: CONNECT, DISCONNECT, BUZZ, WINNER, ANSWER_CORRECT, ANSWER_WRONG, SCORE_CHANGE, TIMER_START, RESET
- Includes timestamp, team, action, and message
- Immutable — appended via SQLite, cannot be modified
- Exportable to CSV and JSON

### Backup & Restore
- Export full competition state as JSON
- Import JSON to restore any previous state
- API: `GET /api/backup` / `POST /api/backup/import`

### PWA (Progressive Web App)
- Installable on Android, iPhone, Windows
- Service worker with Workbox caching
- App manifest with SVG icons

### Network Quality
- Real-time ping measurement (5s interval)
- Quality indicator: good, fair, poor, disconnected
- Auto-reconnect with session restoration

### Winner Animation
- Full-screen overlay animation
- Stamp-in effect with sparkles
- Suitable for projectors

### Sound Effects

- Landscape support on mobile

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm 9+

### Install
```bash
cd quickbuzz
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
Server: http://localhost:3000 | Client: http://localhost:5173

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## LAN Deployment

1. Find your local IP:
   ```bash
   ipconfig           # Windows
   ifconfig | grep inet  # macOS/Linux
   ```

2. Start server: `npm run build && npm run start`

3. Open on connected devices:
   - Judge: `http://192.168.x.x:3000/judge`
   - Teams: `http://192.168.x.x:3000/team/A`
   - Display: `http://192.168.x.x:3000/display`

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

Runs 22 unit tests covering:
- Winner selection (first buzz wins, lock enforcement)
- Lock logic (state transitions)
- Score calculation (add, subtract, set)
- Answer validation (awaiting state, correct scoring)
- Rebuttal mode (activation, lock duration)
- Timer (duration, running state, reset)
- Duplicate protection
- Competition management (create, load)

## OBS Integration

Add these as Browser Sources in OBS:

| Source | URL | Width | Height |
|--------|-----|-------|--------|
| Winner | `/overlay/winner` | 800 | 200 |
| Scores | `/overlay/score` | 400 | 300 |
| Timer | `/overlay/timer` | 200 | 150 |

Enable "Allow transparency" in OBS browser source properties.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/status` | Health check |
| GET | `/api/logs/csv` | Export audit log as CSV |
| GET | `/api/logs/json` | Export audit log as JSON |
| GET | `/api/backup` | Export full database as JSON |
| POST | `/api/backup/import` | Import database from JSON |

## Environment Variables (.env)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Server port |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |

## Configuration (Settings Panel)

- Competition name
- Sound effects on/off + volume
- Dark/Light theme
- Fullscreen toggle

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot connect from other devices
- Check firewall allows port 3000
- Use `0.0.0.0` as HOST (default)
- All devices must be on same WiFi network
- Try `http://[local-ip]:3000` (not localhost)

### SQLite errors
- The `data/` directory is auto-created
- Ensure write permissions in install directory
- Backup before deleting database files

### PWA not installing
- Chrome requires HTTPS or localhost
- iPhone requires Safari browser
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Sound not working
- Browser autoplay policies may require first interaction
- Check sound is enabled in settings
- Increase volume slider
